# Lifecycle

If you find yourself asking either yourself or your DM these questions:

* Can I do this?
* Can I also do this?
* Does ___ count as my turn?
* What is a bonus action?
* What do you mean, I can only cast one concentration spell at a time?
* How many attacks do I get?

you should probably get your shit together. Or use this turn manager.
